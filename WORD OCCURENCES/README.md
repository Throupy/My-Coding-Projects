# Word Occurences

This program parses a website using BeautifulSoup4 and urllib and finds the 5 words with the most occurences.
It then plots the words along with the amount of occurences on a graph using the matplotlib library

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them. I am using pip for windows, a simple google search will give
you results on what to do for your operating system or how to install and use pip.

```
pip install beautifulsoup4
pip install matplotlib
```
