# Email Extractor

This program takes a list of websites to parse, parses them for emails addresses using regex and then checks with DNS servers to see if the emails found actually exist. After that, it saves the valid email addresses to a CSV file. Do whatever you want with this program but I don't take responsibility if someone gets angry at you for having their email address. I am <b>NOT</b> using this program for that purpose I have simply made it for educational purposes only; I have no plans to ever use the program to retreive anyone's email address.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them. I am using pip for windows, a simple google search will give
you results on what to do for your operating system or how to install and use pip.

```
pip install beautifulsoup4
pip install validate_email
```
